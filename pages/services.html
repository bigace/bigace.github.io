    If you are looking for a BIGACE hosting partner, go to our <a href="/hosting/">Hosting</a> page.</p>
<h2>
    Installation Help</h2>
<p>
    You want BIGACE? You have an existing Webhosting account or even your own server? Great!</p>
<p>
    If you checked the <a href="/requirements.html">Requirements</a> successful, we can install the system for you
    within the next 36 hours.</p>
<p>
    The only thing we need is a working FTP account and a <a href="/donate.html">donation</a> (contact us first).</p>
<h2>
    Feature needed soon</h2>
<p>
    We are more than willing to change the development schedule around for a nominal fee for every request.<br>
    Of course, that kind of work will have to be accessible to any other users of BIGACE in the future, but it will help
    you in your time of need.</p>
<h2>
    Private modules / templates</h2>
<p>
    You need some help with a custom module development? You want to have your own Template/Theme?</p>
<p>
    The development team is also willing to help with private module development and other things of that nature, but
    regular consulting fees would apply.</p>
<h2>
    Full projects</h2>
<p>
    If you plan do build a new website with installation, customizing, new modules... contact us, who else does know
    more about BIGACE?!</p>
<p>
    We have more than 15 years of internet, development and project experience. And we believe that BIGACE itself,
    including the Community and websites speak as reference itself, doesn't it?</p>
