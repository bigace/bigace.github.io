    <strong>About myself: </strong><br>
    I am a professional software developer since 2000 now with a german Bachelor degree in Computer Science. I
    develop software in a wide array of languages and always try to stay on the bleeding edge of new technologies and
    methodologies.</p>
<p>
    For a couple of years now I am self-employeed as freelancer and own a web company called
    <a href="http://www.keleo.de/" target="_blank">Keleo</a>, specialized in PHP development ... and Bigace :-)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>About BIGACE:</strong><br>
    When I started with BIGACE I needed a system for myself and wanted to dig deeper into PHP. As the project
    grew and the world of Open Source became a part of my daily life, I published this CMS under the GPL. Its still a
    long way to go, for the future I wish that <a
        href="http://forum.bigace.de/announcements/join-the-bigace-team-and-be-part-of-the-open-source-community/">the
    team grows and we get more hands to improve BIGACE</a>.

    <strong>About myself</strong><strong>: </strong><br>
    I don't have any special programing skills, though I can handle some simple batchfiles and HTML and CSS. Learning
    PHP for me is a game of trial and error, but I already managed to create a useful extension and a <a
        href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:smarty:crystalx" title="Crystal X BIGACE Template">smarty
    template</a>. I started to translate Bigace to swedish just because I liked the superb CMS so much. I have learned a
    lot on the way... As soon as there is enough time, my <a href="http://bmw.dragonslayer.se/" target="_blank">BMW 2002
    tii 1973</a> will be renovated.</p>
<p>
    I run my own webserver using Solaris (it is an u5 270Mhz with 256MB RAM &amp; 8Gb HDD - XBOX).</p>
