<h3>
    Why?!?</h3>
<p>
    Because "<strong>testing</strong>" is one of the most important phases in the software-lifecycle. A well done
    testing period ensures that upgrading current installations of BIGACE will just provide enhancements to your
    software, and not unexpected results.</p>
<p>
    The BIGACE development is frozen (beside some really small changes) during the testing period. It is our last chance
    to fix things before the public release.</p>
<p>
    So please, participate. As more testers we have, as more problems can be found and fixed and this reverts as
    advantage to you and the BIGACE Community.</p>
<h3>
    How to test?</h3>
<p>
    Tests can be done <strong>offline</strong>, by downloading the installation package and testing it in your local
    environment or you can test at our <a href="/demo.html">demo website</a>&nbsp;<strong>online</strong>.</p>
<h3>
    What to test?</h3>
<p>
    Each version is an evolution of the previous one. So, the most important thing to check is that the new version is
    not introducing new bugs not present in the latest public version.</p>
<p>
    The best way to be sure BIGACE will be ok when upgrading, is by testing it on your current applications. In this
    way, things that may be missing in the default applications and layouts can be tested and specific problems can be
    detected.</p>
<h3>
    Where to publish your results</h3>
<p>
    You can leave all comments at the <a href="{{ site.forum_url }}">Forum</a> or the <a href="{{ site.issue_url }}">Issue
    tracker</a> for discussions
    regarding your tests. Just go there and leave any information you think is useful. Not only negative tests results
    are good in this phase, but also positive feedback, so we can measure the results.</p>
<p>
    Please just post information strictly related to testing results. I understand that all you have expectations
    regarding new versions, but consider each version as an evolution of the previous one. No new development will be
    done in a testing phase, just fixes to existing and new issues.</p>
