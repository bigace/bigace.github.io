<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.lazzeretti.net/" target="_blank">Fabrizio Lazzeretti</a> Bigace has another language pack. I&nbsp;hope the italian community will grow and that you spread the word :)</p>
<p>You can read more about the italian translations in the <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/downloads/italian-translations/">forum announcement</a> and on its official <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:language:it">plugin page</a>.</p>
<p>The package was originally made for Bigace 2.7. Its the same with all translation packages:&nbsp;The community needs to give feedback if something might be missing or you want to improve the translations - no one in the team speaks italian so we can only offer the download but do no quality checks - but I&nbsp;believe @Fabrizio:&nbsp;you did a great job and thanks for supporting Bigace!</p>
<p>As bonus, the Bigace installer will from now on come with italian translations. But this is ONLY the installer! <br />
If you want to use italian, please download the extension from the <a title="Bigace Plugins" href="{{ site.plugins_url }}/plugins/">Plugins page</a> and install it via your Administration panel.</p>
<p>And now, what about you:&nbsp;Will you use the new translation package?</p>
