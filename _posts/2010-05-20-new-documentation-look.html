<p>Today I installed a new layout for the <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/">Bigace documentation </a>website, which is currently on high load to document <strike>all</strike> changes for <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/beta-tester/">Bigace 3</a>.</p>
<p>The reason to switch the design was the wish for a more user-friendly page with a cleaner layout and a better reading experience. The todays installation is one of the first steps in the development process for Bigace 3.</p>
<h2>Old design</h2>
<p>Lets start with a short recap on the old documentation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bigace.de/oldwiki-1.png"><img width="350" height="316" src="http://www.bigace.de/oldwiki-1.png?w=350" alt="Screenshot old wiki" /></a></p>
<ul>
    <li>The menu on the left side didn't make much sense and was mostly concentrated on developer topics</li>
    <li>Text formatting didn't fit well for a documentation page</li>
    <li>Especially for user who came from a administrations help link, the integration into the Bigace website design was confusing</li>
    <li>Start page had dozens of links to subpages, chapters were organized by headings</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these topics needed to be addressed and I hope I made a good start with the todays installation:</p>
<h2>New design</h2>
<p>Screenshot new documentation:<br />

<p>As you can see, the menu moved to the right sidebar and currently only has buttons to switch the language and four links to the pages main parts: Home, Manual, Development, Administration (the menu will likely be improved in the future). Also the start page now holds links to 7 subpages, which structure the content in a cleaner way.</p>
<p>Especially when you come from the administration. you won't get distracted from the Bigace websites top menu.</p>
<p>See it live <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/">here</a> :)</p>
