<p>And after a time playing around with <a href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a> I knew what will replace the old code base.</p>
<p>So BIGACE 2.5 is using JQuery in the administration backend. It will be integrated deeper within the next releases.</p>
<p>But why did I change, when everything worked? There are five main reasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>JQuery has the required Plugins for at least <a href="http://www.stilbuero.de/jquery/tabs_3/">Tabbing</a> and <a href="http://tablesorter.com/docs/">Table Sorting</a>, what was currently done with the WebFX <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/tabpane/tabpane.html">TabPane</a> and <a href="http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/sortabletable/sortabletable.html">SortableTable</a></li>
    <li>JQuery is licensed with the GPL and MIT License</li>
    <li>JQuery is up-to-date, has a big community and massive plugins (for example <a href="/Using-JGrowl-for-unobtrusive-notifications.html">JGrowl</a>)</li>
    <li>WebFX is licened with Apache license</li>
    <li>WebFX has a pretty old code base and seems not be maintained lately</li>
</ul>
<p>The Code analysis at Ohloh, where the <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/BIGACE">BIGACE PHP Web CMS</a> is listed since a couple of weeks, showed me the Apache license problem.</p>
<p>BTW: <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/" target="_blank">Ohloh</a> is a great platform, I can recommend that to everyone interested in software development. If you register there, you could add BIGACE to your &quot;used software list&quot; :-D</p>
