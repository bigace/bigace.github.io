<p>Since a couple of weeks everyone is capable of purchasing BIGACE via a <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/saas/" target="_blank">Software-as-a-Service</a> (SaaS) model,  making it easier than ever to get a rich and interactive website up and running with <a title="Web CMS" href="http://www.bigace.de">BIGACE</a>.</p>
<p>The <a title="Application Packaging Standard" href="http://www.apsstandard.org/" target="_blank">APS format</a>, originally created by <a href="http://www.parallels.com/" target="_blank">Parallels</a>,  is designed to enable hosting providers to efficiently provision and install BIGACE on their existing infrastructure using a standard way for APS applications.   And as an APS-compliant application, BIGACE is not only compatible with Parallels Plesk control panel  and Virtuozzo containers but also to Hosting Provider using Open Source alternatives like <a href="http://www.syscp.org/" target="_blank">SysCP</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the BIGACE listing on the APS startpage:</p>

<p>And here the direct link to the <a href="http://www.apsstandard.org/app/#pkg_vendor=www.bigace.de&amp;pkg_name=bigace&amp;pkg_ver=2.6&amp;pkg_rel=3" target="_blank">BIGACE APS detail page</a>  for all of you, who have an APS enabled backend and want to test the package.  Another step forward to make BIGACE more accessible and easy to install!</p>
<p>Please leave some feedback if you could test and work with BIGACE in a SaaS environment!</p>
