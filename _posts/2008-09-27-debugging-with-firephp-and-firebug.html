<p>When I first read about FirePHP I was exited how easy it is to use. And also the time it can safe us, searching log files or scanning database log tables. WOW, one of these scripts you have to know as PHP developer!</p>
<p>And to get a better feeling for the framework (at the end its just one class, but what counts it the advantage it brings), I developed a BIGACE Logger, using FirePHP. Bad enough, I didn't got a better feeling, because its almost too easy to use ;-D</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of it, running in BIGACE with some test log messages:</p>
