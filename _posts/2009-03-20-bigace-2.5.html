	What a long way till we got here. The step from 2.4 to 2.5 is probably the biggest in BIGACE lifetime. Major improvements, like the database UTF-8 migration and the plugin framework have been done.</p>
<p>
	The community grew in the meantime and we got new translations, so BIGACE is now available in 6 languages! We received modules, extensions and templates by the community.</p>
<p>
	I want to thank all the people who contributed and helped with their qualified feedback, bug reports, forum support, translations ...</p>

<p>
	This release is dedicated to the Swedish metalband&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sabaton.net/">Sabaton</a>. They gave me some&nbsp;<a href="" target="_blank">inspiration</a>&nbsp;during long nights of development. But be careful, if you don't like &nbsp;metal, Sabaton might not be your band of choice ;)</p>
<h2>
	Canceled support for 2.4</h2>
<p>
	With a new release, the support for every version lower is canceled. I fully understand, if you are still using 2.4 in production for a couple of weeks, but do not try to build new projects with it! The agreement is: We develop the software and you leave qualified feedback and questions. Its our free time and we do not want to waste it on bug reports for old versions, which might already be fixed.</p>
<p>
	So please everyone: Install and test the new release and then upgrade your running system to 2.5.</p>
<p>
	Now its your turn, spread the word for BIGACE. <strong>Leave your comment, feedback is a great motivation.</strong> Bookmark this page, <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/announcements/join-the-bigace-team-and-be-part-of-the-open-source-community/" title="Become a BIGACE team member!">become a team member</a>, contribute with a new template, help to improve the <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/" title="BIGACE documentation">online documentation</a>.
