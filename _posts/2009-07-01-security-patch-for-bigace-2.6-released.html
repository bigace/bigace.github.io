<p><strong>It is strongly recommended that all users upgrade as soon as possible!</strong></p>
<p>Please install this patch using the extension administration. If it is not possible to <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:manual:updates">install it via administration</a>, use the <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:manual:updates#with_ftp">FTP&nbsp;method</a>. Finally if that also fails, please extract the file /public/index.php from the ZIP&nbsp;and copy it manually to your BIGACE&nbsp;installation.</p>
<p>This vulnerability doesn't work on systems that use an open_basedir setting.</p>
<p>Again, thanks to y3nh4ck3r for letting me know about this problem.</p>
