<p>
	Here is a new version for you, including security updates. I strongly recommend to upgrade your system.</p>
<h2>
	Download file</h2>
<p>
	Get the file from here: <a href="/plugins/get/223-Bigace">Bigace 2.7.8 Download (3.3 MB)</a></p>
<p>
	The update is supported if you run a Bigace version between 2.7.2 - 2.7.7: <a href="/plugins/get/224-Bigace+Upgrade">Bigace 2.7.8 Upgrade (3.2 MB)</a></p>
<h2>
	Upgrade process</h2>
<p>
	The same old procedure like all the times before, <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:upgrade">described in our wiki</a> ;-)</p>
<h2>
	Special thanks</h2>
<p>
	The IT security specialists from <a href="http://jvn.jp/en/">JPCERT/CC</a> reported a possible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_fixation">Session fixation</a> <a href="http://jvndb.jvn.jp/en/contents/2012/JVNDB-2012-000104.html">vulnerability</a> originally found by <a href="http://bogus.jp">Yuji Tounai</a>. They sent me an email and gave me a lot of time to fix the problems, before releasing the security advisory. Thanks for the co-operation research team, very professional and responsible announcing policy!</p>
