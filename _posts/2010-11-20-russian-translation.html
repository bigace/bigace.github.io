<p>Actually the Russian Translation is available since a couple of days now, its just the announcement that follows a bit to late ;-)</p>
<p>You can download the package as always from the <a href="{{ site.plugins_url }}">Plugin page </a>or through your Admin panel.</p>
<p>Oleg Selin was the <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/translations/russian-translation/">contributor</a> and I want to say once again: Thank you for your help and the time you spent in improving Bigace Oleg!</p>
<p>If you have any question please ask in <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/translations/russian-translation/">forum thread</a>.</p>
<p>And have a look at the Plugins page, some of the extension were updated, and others are not yet released but available through the <a href="http://www.bigace.de/nightly-builds.html">nightly build</a> page.</p>
<p>Enjoy the new package!</p>
<p>Regards <br />
Kevin</p>
<p><em>Oh, I&nbsp;have a last question to all of you: There are a lot of languages not translated yet and existing packages might need some review and some update. If you want to help us, you could check the packages at </em><a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/Translation-Check"><em>this website</em></a><em> or even start</em><em> a new one :D</em><em> Every contribution makes Bigace better!</em></p>
