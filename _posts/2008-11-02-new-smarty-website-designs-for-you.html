<p>Today, I have some new templates for you, all of them are meant to be extended by yourself. The framework exists and by installing and applying them to your pages everything will work, but you should have a look into the template structure to get the best out of it.</p>
<h2>New Templates</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:smarty:andreas03">Andreas 03</a> - a Andreas Viklund template (<a target="_blank" href="http://andreasviklund.com/files/demo/andreas03/">live demo</a>)</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:smarty:andreas07">Andreas07</a> - a Andreas Viklund template (<a target="_blank" href="http://andreasviklund.com/files/demo/andreas07/">live demo</a>)</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:smarty:ecobusiness">Ecobusiness</a> - a Studio7Designs template (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensourcetemplates.org/templates/1312612761/">live demo</a>)</li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:smarty:freestyle">Free Style</a> - was completely rewriten (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/3401">live demo</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thanks to the SPHSU</h2>
<p>The Andres03 and Andreas07 were sponsored by the MRC&nbsp;SPHSU (Medical Research Council, Social and Public Health Science).</p>
<p>After I migrated these HTML templates to BIGACE, the SPHSU as early adopters started using them a couple of weeks ago. We made some small changes, to fit their logos and headers inside, but they are based on Andreas Viklunds work. See the <a href="http://www.sphsu.mrc.ac.uk/study-sites/m74/" target="_blank">M74 - Traffic in Glasgow</a> and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sphsu.mrc.ac.uk/study-sites/sharp/" target="_blank">SHARP&nbsp;- Housing and health for Scotland</a> study pages for live demonstration.</p>
