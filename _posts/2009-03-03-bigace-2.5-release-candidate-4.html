<p>Okay, before I tell you about the latest version, I wanted to point you to the the new overview page of all <a title="All available BIGACE versions" href="/bigace-versions/">BIGACE Versions</a>. When you search for informations about a special version, go there and follow these links. This page replaces the old changelog page, which couldn't serve all important informations.</p>
<p>I am always happy to receive some feedback about possible improvements, both about BIGACE&nbsp;and this website. Let me know in the comments!</p>
<h2>Important changes in 2.5 RC4</h2>
<p>I added a simple but powerful Plugin framework, that enables developer to hook into the core system and receive in-time events. Three plugins were changed to demonstrate this behaviour: the <a title="Search Engine Optimization for BIGACE" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:seo">SEO&nbsp;extension</a>, the <a title="Comments for BIGACE" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:addon:comments">comment system</a> and the <a title="Smileys for Comments" href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:extensions:modul:smileys">smileys</a> (improved to hook into comments). You should test these together with the 2.5 RC4 release and leave your thoughts in the <a title="BIGACE Test results" href="http://forum.bigace.de/test-results/">test result forum</a>.</p>
<p>You find the latest plugin downloads on the <a title="BIGACE Nightly Builds" href="/nightly-builds.html">nightly build</a> page, download BIGACE 2.5 RC4 from the <a title="BIGACE Downloads" href="/download.html">download page</a> or directly from <a title="BIGACE 2.5 RC4" href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bigace/bigace_2.5_RC4.zip">here</a>.</p>
<h2>How to use the new plugin framework?</h2>
<p>When you install a plugin, you will find it in the extension administration in the new tab &quot;Plugins&quot; where you can activate and deactivate it. Plugins are PHP&nbsp;files in the new /plugins/ directory, following a simple syntax.</p>
<p>For developer:&nbsp;I will release detailed information for you soon, you can already bookmark the <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:plugins">Plugin Authoring</a> page from the wiki, which will be the entry point in the future.</p>
