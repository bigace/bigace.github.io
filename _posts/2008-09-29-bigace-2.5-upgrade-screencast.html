<p>This video should support you in your upgrade process.&nbsp;Its all about updating your System from BIGACE 2.4 to BIGACE 2.5 (at least RC2, which will be released later this day).</p>
<p>So, if you decide to upgrade your system, I highly recommend to watch this screencast before, to make sure you execute the required steps in the correct order.</p>

I would also like to improve my support, using videos. So you could tell me, which topics could be covered in the next screencasts.</p>
