	Here is a new version for you, including security updates. I strongly recommend to upgrade your system.</p>
<h2>
	Download file</h2>
<p>
	Get the file from here: <a href="/plugins/get/219-Bigace">Bigace 2.7.7 Download (3.3 MB)</a></p>

<p>

<h2>
	Special thanks</h2>
<p>
	The&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://sec4it.dk">IT security specialists from sec4it.dk</a> found some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS</a>&nbsp;vulnerabilities in the login actions and search result pages. They sent me an email and gave me alot of time to fix the problems, before releasing the <a href="http://sec4it.dk/public/index.php?cmd=smarty&amp;id=64_len">security advisory</a>. Thanks for the co-operation research team, very professional and responsible announcing policy!</p>
