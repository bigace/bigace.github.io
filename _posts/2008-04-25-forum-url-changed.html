<p>You might have encountered some problems, reaching the Forum for about 5 minutes. This was because of some mystical behaviors of the Forum software when I moved the Forums &quot;home&quot; to a new subdomain, from <a href="/forum/">http://www.bigace.de/forum/</a> to <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/">http://forum.bigace.de/</a>.</p>
<p>I moved the Forum tonight for three reasons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Practical reasons: Forum is not BIGACE! So users should be able to see that (at least at the URL).</li>
    <li>For easier administration. &quot;Don't want to bother you with boring tech stuff&quot;.</li>
    <li>For SEO reasons: Its easier to analyze traffic and tune web search results.</li>
</ol>
<p>And yes, I have to admit, your Bookmarks are invalid... but they should stil work nevertheless. You should be redirected automatically to the correct &quot;new&quot; URL.</p>
<p>I hope everything works fine, at least posting and surfing - as I tested - still works. <br />
<b>Please let me know if you find any problems!!!!</b></p>
<p>And yes, I promise(!): this will never happen again ;-D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the best wishes,<br />
