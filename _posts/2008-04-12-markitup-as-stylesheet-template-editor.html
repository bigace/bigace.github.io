<p>When I first read about the <b>markItUp! Editor</b>, I was really excited, because it was (nearby) exactly what I was looking for a long time. The only thing I really miss is Syntax highlighting, but well, who knows what time brings ;-D</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jaysalvat.com" target="_blank">Jay Salvat</a> did a great job, the editor is lightweight, builds on existing javascript librarys and is quite easy to extend (see below). Oh, not to forget: It is fast loading.</p>
<p>The best is, if you deactivate javascript, you can still edit the sourcecode as by now, in a simple textarea.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/" target="_blank">http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/</a> for further information and a demo.</p>
<h2>CSS Set Extension</h2>
<p>Because there was no support for CSS editing and I wanted to use the editor in a default installation, I thought it would be a good idea to create and share it with the Community. This is how the Open Souce &amp; Free Software world works: Get something, give something.</p>
<p>You find the official CSS Set at the <a href="http://markitup.jaysalvat.com/downloads/" target="_blank">markItUp! Download page</a>.</p>
<p>I am planning to write another set for Smarty editing, but that might need some days or weeks, my timeplan is full currently.</p>
<h2>Editor Screenshots</h2>
<p>I made some screenshots, so you can get an idea of how it will look like.</p>
<p>This is the Template Editor, which is based on the default HTML Set:</p>
<p><img width="450" height="309" src="/bigace/image/19/template_editor.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>And this is the Stylesheet Editor, with the self-written CSS Set:</p>
<p><img width="450" height="268" src="/bigace/image/18/stylesheet_editor.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Please, share your thoughts on this, tell me what you need when editing Stylesheets and Templates.</p>
