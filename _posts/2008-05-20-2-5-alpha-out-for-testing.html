<p><b><u>Download:</u></b> <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149865&amp;package_id=165947&amp;release_id=404670">Sourceforge Test Package</a></p>
<h2>Improvements</h2>
<p>A lot of enhancements has been added under the surface, not all of of them are accessible right now.</p>
<p>For example one of the most important features: <b>Multiple contents for each page</b> is currently only availble for PHP templates, which are outdated for most users. This will come with the Beta version for testing.</p>
<p>This version uses the <b>markItUp! Editor</b> for HTML Source, Templates and Stylesheet editing.</p>
<p>An <b>event system</b> has been added for easier customization of system tasks - a feature which is more interesting for developer than for users.</p>
<p>The status of <b>Cron Jobs</b> can now be customized.</p>
<p>A new language pack for <b>Swedish</b> is available (thanks to Dragonslayer).</p>
<p>Installation has been easified slightly.</p>
<p>Rad the <a href="/changelog.html">full Changelog</a> for more informations on all changes.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Everybody is asked to download, install and test the new version.</p>
<p>Do NOT use it for updating your current system - and you should not use it for productive sites either!</p>
<p>Feedback is highly appreciated (I cannot test everything by myself) - please post your comments in the <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/index.php/board,8.0.html">Test Results Forum</a>.</p>
