<p>I added a new download page, to allow easy access to these files created once a day. Download these experimental versions of BIGACE that are daily generated from our code that is currently in development.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">WARNING: The nightly builds are UNSTABLE and may not work at all. There is absolutely NO SUPPORT for it from the BIGACE Team, they are provided for testing purposes only. </span></strong></p>
<h2>What is a Nightly Build?</h2>
<p>A nightly build is a snapshot of the currently checked-in BIGACE sources. Our nightly build system creates the same ZIP&nbsp;files like those you can download from Sourceforge.</p>
<p>You find these sources in our CVS (Concurrent Versioning System). Go to our Wiki page to find out more about the <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/bigace:cvs">BIGACE CVS</a>.</p>
<h2>Where can I find these Nightly Builds?</h2>
<p>Go to our <a href="/nightly-builds.html">Nightly Build</a> repository to get the latest development version of BIGACE.</p>
<h2>Why Nightly Builds?</h2>
<p class="intro">Development of BIGACE moves fairly quickly (well at least in some phases) and the daily work break things as often as they are fixed. I claim this to be part of the development process, which aims to produce the most stable releases possible.</p>
<p class="intro">Several issues that existed in previous versions of BIGACE might be fixed, but as long as this version of BIGACE is not finished, you should expect other problems and issues.</p>
<p class="intro"><strong>We need you to <a href="/testing.html">test these nightly builds</a> to provide your </strong><a href="http://forum.bigace.de/test-results/"><strong>feedback</strong></a><strong>. Let us know what you like, what you don't like and escpecially what doesn't work!</strong></p>
<p class="intro">The more people help, the better will be our releases. Do you like our nightly-build-system? How can we help you to help us?</p>
