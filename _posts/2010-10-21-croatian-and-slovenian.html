<p>Its just 5 weeks ago that we received <a href="/Italian-translations.html">Italian as language package</a>. And now we received two more more contributions - which I&nbsp;personally totally like!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Slovenian was done by <a href="http://www.viadom.si/" target="_blank">V.I.A. DOM d.o.o.</a></li>
    <li>Croatian was done by <a href="http://www.prestige-tours.net/" target="_blank">Bruno ÄŒaleta</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can either talk about these packages in the forum threads <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/translations/slovenian/">Slovenian</a> and <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/translations/croatian/">Croatian</a> or grab them from the <a href="http://www.bigace.de/plugins/">Plugins page</a>.</p>
<p>We are looking for more languages and help with the existing packages, if you like to contribute just leave a message!</p>
<p>And thanks to Bruno and milanz for their effort and support for Bigace and its Community :D</p>
