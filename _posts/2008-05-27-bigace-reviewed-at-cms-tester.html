<h2>CMS Tester</h2>
<p>The website can be found at <a target="_blank" href="http://cmstester.com/">http://cmstester.com/</a>.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure, that we will gain a lot of interesting articles and reviews in the future. I'll stay in touch!</p>
<p>And @Mike: Yes, you are right, we have to work on our english translations! I did them all by myself, not the best idea to let a non-native speaker translate a software...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But probably someone reads this and is interested in improving BIGACE by helping us in that task - or by <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/index.php/topic,65.0.html">becoming a team member</a> in any other available position.</p>
