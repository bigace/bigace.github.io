<p>The most important change is the new header. Even if I got really stuck to the old green design, it was time for a change.</p>
<p>These three points were the most important ones, when working on the new design:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The &quot;language chooser/switch&quot; was not obvious to find and many people asked me why there is no german version available</li>
    <li>Have the most important pages always available at a click</li>
    <li>A more professional look, while  at the same time giving the feeling of an &quot;easy to use&quot; application</li>
</ul>
<p>This new design is just the starting point for a bigger customization of the current BIGACE website. But unless there is nothing to see, I will keep this secret ;-) So subscribe to the News feed, to make sure you won't miss the next upcoming details.</p>
<p>You can see the new design in action: <a href="/Test-Template" rel="nofollow">Test Template</a></p>
<p>And here is a screen-design of the new template:</p>
<p><img width="800" height="483" src="/bigace/image/21/new-website-design.jpg" alt="New Website Deisgn for the BIGACE Homepage" /></p>
<p>Leave some thoughts what could be improved, its made for you as well. And since I am no designer, I would appreciate to get some feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, not to forget: the design will be switched in about two weeks, when everything is cleaned up and the Forum and Documentation header is prepared.</p>
