<p>As development with Bigace 3.0 goes on, the improvement of the 2.7 version slows down.</p>
<p>But there is another version out now, which fixes a couple of Bugs and introduces new languages in (pre-)installer and as extension.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.htbridge.ch/">High-Tech Bridge SA</a> from Geneva, Switzerland we could fix a <a href="http://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/path_disclosure_in_bigace_web_cms.html">path disclosure problem</a> in some scripts. Please note that it was only a problem for installations where .htaccess security was not activated during installation!</p>
<p>Some of the new features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>included new translations in pre-installer (now available: German, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, Russian)</li>
    <li>included new translations in installer (now available: German, English, Spanish, Russian, si, hr, Italian, Finnish, Romanian, Turkish)</li>
    <li>using path constants instead of global variables (aka code cleanup)</li>
    <li>broken editor in some rare translation circumstances</li>
    <li>and some other small bugfixes - but I forgot to write them down...</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, now go and <a href="/download.html">grab your download</a> :D</p>
