	Heyho, as you can see, the <a href="/">Bigace website</a> is completely redesigned.&nbsp; I planned that for a long time now, initially I wanted to release it at the same time as Bigace 3... but I needed to bring some new tools online before.</p>
<p>
	If you have a look through the site and find anything broken or a link that is wrong, please report it here as a comment!</p>
<p>
	My best wishes and a <strong>BIG THANK YOU</strong> fly out to<a href="http://www.theauditorymisled.de/" target="_blank"> Torsten HÃ¶ltge</a> for creating the initial design, visual elements and the new logo. Some more credits:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">Tango Icon Theme</a> for providing a great set of free and scalable icons</li>
	<li>
		<a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Webfonts</a> for the nice typo</li>
</ol>
<p>
	As you will find out, the forum has the same design as the website and is now hopefully better readable one large screens. I am pllaning to change the documentation theme as well, but that might need some more days.</p>
<p>
	And as the old structure was hard to maintain, I integrated the developer website and all the tools here, check out the new <a href="/development.html">developer landing page</a>.</p>
<p>
	If you have a look at the page footer you will see, that this website is already running an early version of Bigace 3. I just meantion that, to let you know that the development process for v3 is still ongoing ;)</p>
<p>
	Now tell me: what you think about the new design?</p>
