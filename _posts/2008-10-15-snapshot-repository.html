<p>From now on, I&nbsp;will recently build  a version of BIGACE and of all extensions, which changed in between.</p>
<p>You can fetch them from my server, at the directory: <a rel="nofollow noindex" href="/public/snapshot/" target="_blank">http://www.bigace.de/public/snapshot/</a></p>
<p>Feel free to download and test them. Please give some feedback about the latest changes, it will make your system better as well.</p>
<p>And please remember, that these files are NO release version, they are not meant to be used in productive systems.</p>
