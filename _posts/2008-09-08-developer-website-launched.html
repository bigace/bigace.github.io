<p>The <a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/" title="BIGACE Developer Resources">website</a> just launched, so its in an open Beta phase currently. I encourage you to have a look, test<br />
the given tools and leave your feedback!<br />
<br />
As well as that, the <a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/">website</a> is launched with the <a href="/website-going-to-change-its-template.html">new design</a>, that will be carried out across the other<br />
BIGACE websites, like this one and the <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/">forum</a> and <a href="http://wiki.bigace.de/">wiki</a>. I ask you, to have a look around and test with <br />
different browsers. Can you see differences? Is anything broken in Safari or Internet Explorer?<br />
<br />
The first tools I published for you are these:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/Template-Creator">Template Creator</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/Module-Creator">Module Creator</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/CMSMS-Themes-Converter">CMSCMS Theme Converter</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those tools are nearer described at the <a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/Development-Tools">tools introduction page</a>. I hope they will be usefull for you.<br />
<br />
New ideas are welcome, also bug reports ... And if the tools save your time, donations are welcome as well!<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw. your modules and themes can be <a href="http://forum.bigace.de/index.php?board=18.0">published in the forum</a>, to be used across the community. I can add them to the remote search as well, after a short review.</p>
<p>Here is the full link to the new website: <a href="http://dev.bigace-cms.com/">http://dev.bigace-cms.com/</a></p>
