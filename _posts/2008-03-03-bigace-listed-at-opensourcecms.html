<p>Yes, it is true...&nbsp; I should have asked the friendly people at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opensourcecms.com/">OpenSourceCMS</a> much earlier to integrate BIGACE into their Demo System. And then, when I finally did, it took a couple of months, until the other systems on waiting list where installed.</p>
<p>But now, we are there! And I really hope, that more user find BIGACE and choose it as their CMS solution.</p>
<p>You could do me a favour and post a (positive) comment on their page, rate it and let people know what you think. Help me, pushing the System to the place where it should belong.</p>
