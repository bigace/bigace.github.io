	With a new release, the support for every version before is stopped. New versions fix old bugs, so please upgrade as soon as possible. The agreement is: We develop the software and you leave qualified feedback and questions. Its our free time and we do not want to waste it on bug reports for old versions, which might already be fixed.</p>
<p>
	So please everyone: Install and test the new release and then upgrade your running system to 2.6.</p>

He will release an exploit soon, which makes it possible in some circumstances to inject the BIGACE database. So everybody is HIGHLY&nbsp;ASKED&nbsp;to upgrade as soon as possible!</p>
