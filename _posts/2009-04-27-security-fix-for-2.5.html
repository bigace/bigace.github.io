<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This bug was existing since 2.4. In BIGACE 2.4 it was only useable with PHP&nbsp;systems turned &quot;magic_quotes_gpc = Off&quot; which instead in most systems is turned &quot;On&quot;. With code changes for BIGACE 2.5, which were necessary for compatibility issues with the upcoming PHP 6, the bug became widly useable, so even systems with deactivated <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/security.magicquotes.php" target="_blank">magic_quotes</a> were attackable.</p>
<p>The only requirement was to know the username of an account with enough permissions, so all systems using the default username &quot;admin&quot; were in high danger.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>Big thanks to merpil. He worked together with me, gave me insides of his website, logfiles and time to find out whats going on while his website was defaced twice.</p>
<p>@Defacement crew who originally found that bug: Sorry, not a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_day_attack">Zero-Day-Exploit</a> anymore. I would haven given you the credibility and probably even a backlink if you came to me in first place, but using your knowledge to destroy other peoples work is just a stupid behaviour...&nbsp;</p>
